            <p class="about-p">A magnetic disc is an easiest way to implement the secondary memory.
                Each disk platter has a flat circular shape like a CD or DVD. Both the surfaces of the platter are
                covered with magnetic material.
                There are headers on both sides of the platter, hence read and write operations can be performed on both
                the sides.
                The surface of the disc is divided into circular tracks. Tracks are further divided into sectors.
                Seek Time: It is defined as the time required to move the read-write head on to the desired track.</p>

            <h1>Why do we need Disk Scheduling Algorithms?</h1>
            <p>Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk
                scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling.</p>

                <p class="para">Multiple I/O requests may arrive by different processes and only one I/O request can be served at a
                    time by the disk controller. Thus other I/O requests need to wait in the waiting queue and need to
                    be scheduled.</p>
