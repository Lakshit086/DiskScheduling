        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Seek Time: </strong>Seek time is the time taken to locate the disk arm to a specified track where the data is to be read or write. So the disk scheduling algorithm that gives minimum average seek time is better.</p>
            <p><strong>Rotational Latency: </strong>Rotational Latency is the time taken by the desired sector of disk to rotate into a position so that it can access the read/write heads. So the disk scheduling algorithm that gives minimum rotational latency is better.</p>
            <p><strong>Transfer Time: </strong>Transfer time is the time to transfer the data. It depends on the rotating speed of the disk and number of bytes to be transferred.</p>
            <p><strong>Disk Response Time: </strong>Response Time is the average of time spent by a request waiting to perform its I/O operation. Average Response time is the response time of the all requests. Variance Response Time is measure of how individual request are serviced with respect to average response time. So the disk scheduling algorithm that gives minimum variance response time is better.</p>
            <p><strong>Disk Access Time: </strong>Disk Access Time is:</p>
            <code>
                Disk Access Time = Seek Time + 
                Rotational Latency + 
                Transfer Time

        <h1 id="algo-heading">First Come First Serve (FCFS)</h1>
        <p id="algo_p">FCFS is the simplest disk scheduling algorithm. As the name suggests, this algorithm entertains requests in the order they arrive in the disk queue. The algorithm looks very fair and there is no starvation (all requests are serviced sequentially) but generally, it does not provide the fastest service.</p>

        <h1 id="algo-heading">SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)</h1>
        <p id="algo_p"> In SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First), requests having shortest seek time are executed first. So, the seek time of every request is calculated in advance in the queue and then they are scheduled according to their calculated seek time. As a result, the request near the disk arm will get executed first. SSTF is certainly an improvement over FCFS as it decreases the average response time and increases the throughput of system.Let us understand this with the help of an example.</p>

        <p id="algo_p">In SCAN disk scheduling algorithm, head starts from one end of the disk and moves towards the other end, servicing requests in between one by one and reach the other end. Then the direction of the head is reversed and the process continues as head continuously scan back and forth to access the disk. So, this algorithm works as an elevator and hence also known as the elevator algorithm. As a result, the requests at the midrange are serviced more and those arriving behind the disk arm will have to wait.</p>

        <p id="algo_p">The circular SCAN (C-SCAN) scheduling algorithm is a modified version of the SCAN disk scheduling algorithm that deals with the inefficiency of the SCAN algorithm by servicing the requests more uniformly. Like SCAN (Elevator Algorithm) C-SCAN moves the head from one end servicing all the requests to the other end. However, as soon as the head reaches the other end, it immediately returns to the beginning of the disk without servicing any requests on the return trip (see chart below) and starts servicing again once reaches the beginning. This is also known as the “Circular Elevator Algorithm” as it essentially treats the cylinders as a circular list that wraps around from the final cylinder to the first one.</p>
